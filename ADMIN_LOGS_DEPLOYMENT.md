# Admin Logs Feature - Deployment Steps

## What Was Added
- ‚úÖ New API endpoint: `/api/admin/scraping-logs`
- ‚úÖ New component: `ScrapingLogsViewer.tsx`

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Commit and Push
```bash

git commit -m "Add comprehensive scraping logs viewer to admin panel with tabs, filtering, and export"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Wait for GitHub Actions
- Check the Actions tab on GitHub
- Wait for the deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

### 3. Test the Feature
Once deployed, test the new feature:

```bash
# Test the logs API
BASE_URL=https://vaatwasstripsvergelijker.server.devjens.nl node scripts/test-admin-logs.js
```

Or manually:
1. Go to https://vaatwasstripsvergelijker.server.devjens.nl/data-beheer
2. Login with admin credentials
3. Click on the "Scraping Logs" tab
4. Test filtering, export, and cleanup features

## No Database Changes Required
- The ScrapingLog model already exists in the schema
- No need to run `push-schema` or `seed`
- The logs will be populated automatically when scrapers run

## Features Available After Deployment
- üìä **Dashboard Tab**: Original product management
- üìù **Scraping Logs Tab**: New logs viewer with:
  - Real-time log viewing
  - Status and supplier filtering
  - CSV export functionality
  - Old logs cleanup (30+ days)
  - Summary statistics (24h)

## Next Scrape Will Generate Logs
After deployment, the next scraping operation (manual or scheduled) will start populating the logs table, which you can then view in the admin panel.
