# Award Filtering Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented the award-based filtering system with the new OptimizedProductCard component that displays product variants from the database.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **OptimizedProductCard Component** (`components/OptimizedProductCard.tsx`)
- Created a new product card component based on `card_new.tsx`
- Features:
  - Mobile-responsive design with bottom sheet for variant selection on mobile
  - Desktop dropdown for variant selection
  - Award badges display (Best Review, Most Sustainable, Best Price)
  - Dynamic color schemes based on supplier
  - Variant pricing with "Best Value" indicators
  - Sustainability score visualization
  - Integration with product URLs and brand pages

### 2. **Award Calculation System** (`utils/calculateAwards.ts`)
- Calculates which products receive awards based on:
  - **Best Review**: Highest rating score
  - **Best Sustainability**: Highest sustainability score
  - **Best Price**: Lowest price per wash across all variants
- Awards are calculated dynamically from the product data

### 3. **Homepage Refactoring**
- Split into server component (`app/page.tsx`) and client component (`app/HomePage.tsx`)
- Server component handles:
  - Metadata export for SEO
  - Initial data fetching from database
- Client component handles:
  - Interactive filtering with 5 filter options
  - Product transformation to include variants
  - Award calculation and display
  - Responsive grid layout

### 4. **Database Integration**
- Updated `lib/db-safe.ts` to include product variants in queries
- Products now fetch with their associated variants
- Fallback to default variant if no variants exist

### 5. **Filter Options**
Implemented 5 simple filter options:
- **Alle producten** (default) - Shows all products
- **Beste reviews** - Shows products with best review award
- **Meest duurzaam** - Shows products with best sustainability award
- **Beste prijs** - Shows products with best price award
- **Op voorraad** - Shows only in-stock products

## Key Features

### Mobile Optimization
- Bottom sheet modal for variant selection on mobile devices
- Responsive award badges (icon-only on mobile)
- Touch-friendly interface elements

### Variant Management
- Each product can have multiple pack size variants
- Automatic "Best Value" calculation
- Default variant indication
- Price per wash comparison

### Visual Design
- Brand-specific color schemes
- Award badges with icons (Star, Leaf, Euro)
- Sustainability score progress bars
- Hover effects and transitions

## Data Structure
Products are transformed to include:
```typescript
{
  id: string,
  name: string,
  supplier: string,
  rating: number,
  reviewCount: number,
  inStock: boolean,
  url: string,
  sustainabilityScore: number,
  awards: {
    bestReview?: boolean,
    bestSustainability?: boolean,
    bestPrice?: boolean
  },
  variants: [{
    id: string,
    name: string,
    washCount: number,
    price: number,
    pricePerWash: number,
    isDefault: boolean,
    originalPrice?: number
  }]
}
```
