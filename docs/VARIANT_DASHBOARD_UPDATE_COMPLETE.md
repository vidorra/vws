# Product Dashboard Variant Display Update

## Overview
Successfully updated the admin dashboard at `/data-beheer` to display product variants with an expandable accordion interface. The dashboard now shows all variants for products that have multiple pack sizes.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Updates (`app/api/admin/dashboard/route.ts`)
- Modified the products query to include variants relation
- Added variants to the formatted product response
- Each product now returns its associated variants ordered by wash count

### 2. Dashboard UI Updates (`app/data-beheer/page.tsx`)
- Added `ProductVariant` interface to define variant structure
- Updated `Product` interface to include optional variants array
- Added expandable row functionality with state management
- Implemented accordion-style variant display with:
  - Chevron icons for expand/collapse
  - Variant count indicator
  - Clean, organized variant cards showing:
    - Variant name
    - Wash count
    - Price and price per wash
    - Stock status
    - Default variant indicator

### 3. Edit Modal Updates (`components/EditProductModal.tsx`)
- Added `ProductVariant` interface
- Updated `Product` interface to include variants
- Added read-only variants section in the edit modal
- Variants are displayed but cannot be edited (as they're managed by scrapers)
- Added informational note about automatic variant updates

### 4. Delete Functionality
- No changes needed - Prisma cascade delete handles variant removal automatically
- When a product is deleted, all associated variants are removed

## Features Implemented

### Expandable Variant Display
- Products with variants show a chevron icon
- Click to expand/collapse variant details
- Shows variant count when collapsed
- Clean card-based layout for each variant

### Variant Information Shown
- Variant name (e.g., "2 Dozen - 160 wasbeurten")
- Total wash count
- Price per pack
- Price per wash
- Stock status (color-coded)
- Default variant indicator

### Edit Modal Enhancement
- Variants displayed in read-only section
- Clear indication that variants are managed automatically
- Maintains all existing product editing functionality

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Visual Hierarchy**: Main product shows aggregated data, variants show detailed options
2. **Space Efficiency**: Collapsed by default to keep table clean
3. **Clear Indicators**: Variant count and expand/collapse icons
4. **Consistent Styling**: Matches existing dashboard design patterns
5. **Informative**: Shows all relevant variant data at a glance

## Technical Considerations

1. **Performance**: Variants loaded with products in single query
2. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with interfaces
3. **State Management**: Efficient expand/collapse state handling
4. **Database Relations**: Leverages Prisma relations properly
5. **Cascade Delete**: Automatic cleanup of variants on product deletion

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding variant-specific editing if needed in future
2. Add variant price history tracking
3. Implement variant-specific stock alerts
4. Add export functionality that includes variant data
5. Consider variant comparison features

## Testing Checklist

✅ Products with variants show expand icon
✅ Clicking expands to show all variants
✅ Variant data displays correctly
✅ Edit modal shows variants in read-only section
