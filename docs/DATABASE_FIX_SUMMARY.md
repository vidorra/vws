# Database Connection Fix Summary

## Problem
You were experiencing PostgreSQL connection errors in production:
- "Socket not connected"
- "Connection reset by peer"

## Root Cause
These errors occur when:
1. Database connections are exhausted
2. Connections timeout in containerized environments
3. No retry logic for transient connection failures

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Connection Pooling (DATABASE_URL)
Updated the connection string to include pooling parameters:
```
postgresql://...?connection_limit=5&pool_timeout=30
```

### 2. Retry Logic (lib/db-connection.ts)
Created a `withRetry` function that:
- Retries failed operations up to 3 times
- Implements exponential backoff
- Reconnects on connection errors
- Handles specific Prisma error codes

### 3. Updated Prisma Client (lib/prisma.ts)
- Added proper cleanup on process exit
- Configured datasource explicitly
- Maintains singleton pattern for development

### 4. Updated All Database Operations (lib/db/products.ts)
Wrapped all database calls with `withRetry`:
```typescript
return withRetry(() => 
  prisma.product.findMany({...})
);
```

### 5. Enhanced Health Check (app/api/health/route.ts)
Added database connection status to health endpoint for monitoring

## Deployment Steps

1. **Update CapRover Environment Variables**:
   - Add the connection parameters to DATABASE_URL
   - Add DB_MANAGEMENT_SECRET for schema management

2. **Deploy the Code**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix database connection issues"
   git push origin main
   npm run deploy
   ```

3. **Apply Schema Changes**:
   ```bash
   export DB_MANAGEMENT_SECRET=your-secret
   ./scripts/manage-remote-db.sh push-schema
   ```

4. **Monitor**:
   - Check health endpoint: `/api/health`
   - Watch CapRover logs for connection errors
   - Verify admin panel functionality

## Files Modified

1. `lib/prisma.ts` - Added connection cleanup
2. `lib/db-connection.ts` - New file with retry logic
3. `lib/db/products.ts` - Wrapped all queries with retry
4. `app/api/health/route.ts` - Added DB status check
5. `CAPROVER_ENV_VARS.md` - Updated with connection params
6. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added connection pool comment

## Expected Results

After deployment, you should see:
- No more connection reset errors
- Automatic recovery from transient failures
- Better connection management
- Improved monitoring capabilities

The retry logic will handle temporary connection issues automatically, making your application more resilient to database connection problems.
