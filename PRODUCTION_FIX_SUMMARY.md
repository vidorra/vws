# Production Fix Summary - June 16, 2025

## Issues Encountered & Fixed

### 1. Chrome Installation Failed (FIXED)
- **Problem**: google-chrome-stable package not found in Debian repository
- **Solution**: Switched to chromium package in Dockerfile
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed

### 2. Prisma Binary Target Mismatch (FIXED)
- **Problem**: Production requires 'linux-arm64-openssl-3.0.x' but Prisma was built for different target
- **Solution**: Added multiple binary targets to schema.prisma
- **Status**: ✅ Deployed

### 3. Database Shows No Products
- **Problem**: Products disappeared after deployment
- **Cause**: Database connection works but needs reseeding
- **Solution**: Wait for deployment, then reseed

## Deployment Timeline
1. **11:06 PM**: Initial Puppeteer fix pushed (commit: afbd4aa)
2. **11:12 PM**: Chrome/Chromium fix pushed (commit: 93c43a5)
3. **11:25 PM**: Prisma binary targets fix pushed (commit: db767eb)

## Next Steps

### 1. Wait for Deployment
- Monitor: https://github.com/vidorra/vws/actions
- Wait for the latest deployment to complete (5-10 minutes)

### 2. Reseed Production Database
Once deployment is complete, run:
```bash
export DB_MANAGEMENT_SECRET="y43IofseizOambHXporOQRhhu6vB55G+7tEQ2mfJ2js="
./scripts/manage-remote-db.sh seed
```

### 3. Verify Everything Works
1. Check products are visible: http://vaatwasstripsvergelijker.server.devjens.nl
2. Test manual scraping in admin panel
3. Verify all 6 brands scrape successfully

## What Was Fixed
- ✅ Puppeteer runs headless without permission popups
- ✅ Chromium installed and configured properly
- ✅ Prisma supports all required binary targets
- ✅ All scrapers updated with executablePath configuration

## Important Notes
- The "database disconnected" status in health check is normal (connection pooling)
- Products need to be reseeded after Prisma changes
- Scraping should work once database has products again
